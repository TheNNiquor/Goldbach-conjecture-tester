# Prime-Number-Nerding
Occasional prime number coding 

goldbach.py is a script to test the Goldbach conjecture up to a certain number. It is not mean to be efficient at finding the prime sums for high even numbers. It is just for visualizing how the sums of primes behave. Any contribution to this code will be welcome.

Cheers!
